# Introduction

NextColony is a last days space simulation with RPG elements and tradeable collectibles built on the Steem blockchain. This game will change your life, rescue Steem and make this environment the most imaginative place in the entire universe.

This documentation explains the custom JSON format of the blockchain transactions, the REST API and essential parts to allow verification of the game activities based on the blockchain transactions. It also helps developers to build their own tools for NextColony on top of the steem blockchain and the game server.
